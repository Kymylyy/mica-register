# Prompt dla ChatGPT/Gemini - Propozycje Faviconów

## Prompt do wklejenia:

```
I'm designing a favicon for a professional web application called "MiCA Register" - a database interface for displaying ESMA (European Securities and Markets Authority) crypto-asset service provider register data.

**Application Context:**
- Purpose: Display and filter licensed crypto-asset service providers in the EU
- Target audience: Legal professionals, regulators, financial services industry
- Style: Professional, clean, regulatory/legal context
- Current color scheme: Blue tones (#2563eb, #1e40af) matching the application design
- Technology: React + Tailwind CSS web application

**Current Favicon Options I've Created:**
1. Simple letter "M" (MiCA) on blue square
2. "MR" (MiCA Register) on blue square
3. Letter "M" in a circle
4. Document/register symbol with checkmark
5. Blockchain/crypto symbol (circles with connecting lines)
6. Shield with "M" (representing regulation)
7. Minimalist document icon

**Requirements:**
- Must be readable at 16x16px (favicon size)
- Should work as SVG format
- Professional and appropriate for legal/regulatory context
- Should relate to: MiCA regulation, crypto-assets, service providers, register/database
- Color: Blue tones preferred, but open to suggestions
- Simple and clean design (not too complex for small size)

**What I'm Looking For:**
Please suggest 5-7 new favicon concepts with:
1. Description of each concept
2. Rationale for why it fits this application
3. Key visual elements (shapes, symbols, letters)
4. Color suggestions
5. How it relates to MiCA/crypto-assets/regulation theme

Consider:
- Combining regulatory symbols (shield, document, checkmark) with crypto/blockchain elements
- Using "M" or "MR" in creative ways
- Symbols that represent "register" or "database"
- European/regulatory context (ESMA is EU authority)
- Professional legal/financial services aesthetic

Please provide creative, professional suggestions that would work well for a regulatory database interface.
